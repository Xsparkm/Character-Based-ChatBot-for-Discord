# Character-Based-ChatBot-for-Discord
This project is a character-based chatbot for Discord that uses a JSON knowledge base to respond to user queries with predefined answers. It employs the difflib library to find the closest match for user questions and responds accordingly, making it easy to customize for different characters.
